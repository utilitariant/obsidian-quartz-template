Which of the following features is important for the recognition of the **initiation codon** in **prokaryotic** mRNAs?

- [ ] CAP

- [ ] TATA box

- [ ] CAAT box

- [x] Shine-Dalgarno box

- [ ] Poly (A) tail

>[!check]- Explaination...
>  The [[Shine-Dalgarno box]] is a nucleotide sequence that precedes the initiation codon in Prokaryotic mRNA, which is recognized by, and acts as the binding site for the the 30S ribosomal subunit, in order to initiate translation. 
>  
>  Equivalent function to the 5' methylated cap in eukaryotic translation

Cells of which of the following bacterial genotypes would be able to utilize lactose as an energy source and grow?

- [ ] $I^+\ O^+\ Z^+\ Y^-\ /\ I^s\ O^+\ Z^-\ Y^+$
	$I^s$ - Super repressor (trans-acting, one copy acts on all operators).  Operator sequence... Operon repressed... lactose cannot be metabolized.

- [ ] $I^s\ O^+\ Z^+\ Y^+$
	Superrepressor present... inducible Operator sequence... Operon repressed... lactose cannot be metabolized.

- [x] $I^+\ O^c\ Z^+\ Y^-\ /\ I^+\ O^+\ Z^-\ Y^+$
	one operator mutant cannot be repressed, operon expression is continuous (Constitutive)... 
	`does the gene a mutant allele is on matter it would for cis-acting regulation correct? would this combination result in excsss beta-galactosidase that metabolizes lactose before its isomer can induce the repressor protein`

- [ ] $I^+\ O^+\ Z^-\ Y^+$
	β-galactosidase not synthesized so lactose cannot be metabolized.

`for 1, and 3, is the second gene provided by transformation (like present in a plasmid that has been incororated into a bacteria?, also if bacteria recieve a operon, will they always inly incorporate the functional alleles if mutant alleles exist in the transformed DNA? or if a bacteria has mutant alleles in its own operon, will it only incorporate the Functional alleles, or will it just incorporate the intire operon in place of its own? (When transformation results in incorpotration, instead of only mRNA bieng intriduced that hijacks the cellular nachinery) also how does it translate 2 genes when it undergoes cell division, is there bacterial recombination or will plasmid just be duplacted along with everytinh else?`

# 3
What protein factor is responsible for binding the initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAi) in **eukaryotes**?

- [ ] eIF1

- [ ] IF2

- [ ] eIF3

- [ ] eEF-G

- [x] eIF2

- [ ] eIF4

>[!check]- Explanation...
> IF2 Is the protein that binds initial tRNA to the P site of the Ribosome.
> 
 (eIF2) e prefix indicates the protein present/utilized in eukaryotes.

# 4
What site on the ribosome does the **initiator tRNA** bind to?

- [ ] A

- [x] P

- [ ] E

- [ ] either A or P

>[!check]- Explanation...
> The initial tRNA binds to the P site so that it can synthesize the first peptide bond between the initiator amino acid and the subsequent amino acid that comes into the A site.

`is there an aspect of the AUG codon (or UAC anicodon) that facilitates its binding to the P site specifically?`

In a strain of E.coli that is partial diploid with a genotype: $$I^+\ O^+\ Z^+\ Y^+\ /\ I^-\ O^c\ Z^+\ Y^-$$ The expression of galactosidase and permease is ___ and ___ , respectively.

- [ ] constitutive, constitutive

- [ ] inducible, inducible

- [x] constitutive, inducible

- [ ] inducible, no expression

>[!check]- Explanation...

# 8
Which of the following sets of conditions would result in high levels of gene transcription from the _lac_ operon?

- [ ] No glucose, no lactose

- [ ] High glucose, no lactose

- [x] No glucose, high lactose

- [ ] High glucose, high lactose

>[!check]- Explaination...

# 9 
If you grow _E.coli_ cells in the presence of both glucose and lactose, _lac_ operon is turned off because $...$

- [ ] Glucose activates the repressor

- [ ] Glucose binds to cAMP receptor protein and inactivates it

- [ ] Glucose inhibits the uptake of lactose

- [x] Glucose inhibits the production of cAMP

- [ ] Glucose binds the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter

Which of the following is an example of an effector molecule?

# 11
Which of the following statements is **incorrect** about the regulation of lactose (_Lac_) operon?

- [ ] Lactose induces the expression of the Lac operon

- [ ] In the absence of lactose in the medium, LacI binds operator and blocks transcription of Lac operon.

- [ ] In the presence of lactose in the medium, LacI is released from the Lac operon resulting in Lac operon expression.

- [ ] Loss of Lacl results in low expression of Lac operon in the presence of lactose

- [ ] Loss of LacI results in expression of Lac operon in the absence of lactose

- [ ] The binding of lactose/allolactose to LacI results in conformational change (shape change) in this protein.

# 13
You isolated an _E. coli_ mutant that is expressing high levels of the lac operon in the absence of lactose (i.e., constitutive expression of the lac operon). What are the two mutations that can result in constitutive expression of the lac operon? In a given constitutive expression mutant, how can you determine which of these two mutations has occurred?
